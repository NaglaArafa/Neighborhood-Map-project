NeighborHood Map Project
=========================

## Description

a single page application featuring a map of places I want to go. I will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

The app allows you to filter the list of locations as you type. In return, it displays the filtered locations on the map and on the list.

I used [FourSquare Api](https://developer.foursquare.com/) as a 3rd=part APi to get the needed information about my locations.
